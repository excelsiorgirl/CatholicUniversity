<h2 style="font-family:Calibri"><a>Who they are…</a></h2>
<p style="font-family:Calibri">	The National Museum of Natural History, belonging to the prestigious Smithsonian Institute (SI) system of museums, provides educational and interactive exhibits on the natural world, including but not limited to: anthropology, botany, zoology, and mineral sciences. The museum is open 364 days a year and served nearly 5 million visitors in 2023 [1].

	The museum debuted as a natural history museum (under the name U.S. National Museum) in 1910 and after congressional legislation allowed for the founding of the Smithsonian Institute 1846 [2]. The institute, and subsequent museums, were created by and receive funding from the United States federal government (two thirds of its annual $1.25 billion budget) and operate as a trust instrumentality, instead of as part of one of the three branches of government [3].

	The mission and goal of the museum is to serve the American public and augment national and international research on natural history, while remaining non-partisan and operating under federal budget restraints.
</p>

<h2 style="font-family:Calibri">How they serve…</h2>
<p style="font-family:Calibri">	Due to the nature of its free admission, ownership, funding, and mission as a public education institution the museum aims to reach Americans and foreign tourists of all ages, backgrounds, and socioeconomic statuses. The Natural History museum (its local name) hosts a collection of research pertaining to the subjects of the museum and its mission that is available to the public on a 24/7/365 basis and aims to inform users and cultivate a knowledgeable community of both academics and those of amateur interest [4].

	The Natural History museum research collections are available at <a href="https://collections.nmnh.si.edu/search/">collections.nmnh.si.edu</a> and include functions to search, browse, and analyze statistics of the ten collection units.

	The nature of the inclusive, constantly accessible, and entirely public collections means that users come from across the globe and many fields including a variety of academic disciplines as well as non-academics pursuing personal research or looking to broaden their natural history experience, which would be otherwise inaccessible without the museum collections.	
</p>

<h2 style="font-family:Calibri">What they collect…</h2>
<p style="font-family:Calibri">	The Natural History museum collections consists of ten museum collection units totaling 11,301,532 specimen records, although not representing the museum’s full collection nor all digitized records (as more are added on a rolling basis.) [4]

	The search, browse, and analyze functions are available within each unit and operate by keywords. Each unit’s webpage links to an introduction of the unit subject on the SI home site (as opposed to the research collections site.) [5] The digital objects in the collections consist of digitized scans of paper documents, pottery and human carvings, zoological and palaeobiological specimens (such as insects, fossils, or animals), and plants or minerals. The search results include catalog number, kind of object, identification, country, and more, depending on the unit. [4]	
</p>

<h4 style="text-align right;font-family:Calibri">The collection units are as follows: </h4>
<ul style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;text-align right;font-family:Calibri">
    <li>Department of Anthropology (497,478 records)</li>
    <li>Department of Botany (4,555,435 records)</li>
    <li>Department of Entomology (722,115 records)</li>
    <li>Department of Invertebrate Zoology (2,004,174 records)</li>
    <li>Department of Mineral Sciences (462,284 records)</li>
    <li>Department of Paleobiology (724,162 records)</li>
    <li>Department of Vertebrate Zoology:</li>
    <li>Division of Amphibians & Reptiles (612,515 records)</li>
    <li>Division of Birds (592,744 records)</li>
    <li>Division of Fishes (498,096 records)</li>
    <li>Division of Mammals (625,987 records)(612,515 records)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Discussion</h2>

<p>	The Natural History museum is unique among many museums in the United States as its subject matter is relatively without personal or cultural biases, since the research specimens indisputably exist and are for the most part Earth-born, yet unlive, lacking social sensitivities (with the exclusion of the anthropology unit), in addition to being mostly born of accountable public funds. However, a pressing and grievous problem the museum perpetuates in the housing of over 5,000 illegally obtained Native American artifacts, therefore presenting the issue of ethical repatriation of artifacts to their rightful owners. [6]
</p>

<p>	The Natural History museum benefits from its prestige and position as an iconoclast in the eyes of the American people while suffering from limited and volatile budgets. The museum, and other SI museums, are among the most respected and visited of their kind in the country, leading to the legitimate need for more programming and collections manpower, while drawing in thousands of academics who contribute invaluable assets.[1] However, because the budget is decided each year by a two party congress, the museum must conduct its work under public funds, a limited budget, and defer to the whims of the current administration.[6]
</p>

<p>	Suggested improvements to the collections site are among two categories, functional and editorial. Starting with the latter, the research collections site suffers from typos, missing headers, and sentences that are cut off before finishing. The site requires a dedicated copywriter with experience in technical science writing for the layman. Many government agencies require public announcements and documents to be written at a seventh grade level, making it accessible to all of the public no matter the education or English level [7].

	For the former category, the functionality of the search function would be greatly improved by a feature allowing the user to browse the digital objects by the technical headings turned up by the search function, without having to manually input browsing specifications which currently require knowledge of the catalog number or otherwise generally inaccessible information. This issue is most easily fixed by expanding the “quick browse” function which enables general browsing of a category without needing specifics, yet is currently limited to only three subjects per collection unit. </p>
