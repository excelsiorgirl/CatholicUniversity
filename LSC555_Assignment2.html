<h2 style="text-align:center;font-family:Arial;">Heuristic Analysis</h2>

<p style="font-family:Calibri">If one considers The Tower’s usability from the perspective of a student attempting to locate issues on changing attitudes towards world religion, there are major road-blocks for the student to overcome. When using The Tower’s site there are no response time indicators to mitigate the frustration of slow-loading webpages, instead the scans of the newspaper appear block-by-block with no rhyme or reason. This limits fast browsing making it hard to sort through the large assortment of files on religion needed to complete an assignment.</p>

<p style="font-family:Calibri">The interaction efficiency is fair if the student has used the site before and knows that using the “search” function or “sort” by date are the best ways to find information using under four mouse clicks. The site’s use of color greatly benefits the student’s search as the scans and buttons are in neutral colors for ease of reading. A student can readily navigate to relevant topics on religion and quickly scan issues of The Tower for quotes and photos required to write about.</p>

<p style="font-family:Calibri">The site’s text is well laid out with short paragraphs in sans-serif font and is only limited by the fact that the scanned newspapers must take up a large and awkward amount of space on the page, leaving not as much room for the text. The site’s navigation presents difficulties for the student as it lacks breadcrumbs for navigating backwards, lacks pull-down menus to economize space, and the pages give no indication as to what they contain unless you read each line of text individually. Even though the text is readable the student may encounter frustration trying to go back to a previous page and become lost resulting in starting over and wasting their limited time towards a due date.</p>

<p style="font-family:Calibri">The multiculturality aspect is positive as the webpage lacks many outstanding features or designs that would raise eyebrows, assuming that the student is aware that the university is of Catholic affiliation. A student studying religion for an assignment will have no trouble with encountering negative surprises related to culture. The Tower’s website provides users with minimal graphics and animations, a positive feature as the site’s information is largely based on PDF scans. However, the animations of pages turning on the scans serves no purpose and can be distracting to a student that needs to focus. </p>

<p style="font-family:Calibri">The website’s consistency is lacking because it does not rely on mimicking well-known layouts, making the site confusing for users who are looking at it for the first time. The most positive aspect of the site for a user is the front and center “About” page tab that is always at the top banner, leading to contact information and documentation. Students who regularly use The Tower to provide sources for a paper on religion will have an easier time but unfamiliar students will be able to access help on the “About” page.</p>


<h2 style="text-align:center;font-family:Arial;">Site Strengths and Weaknesses</h2>

<p style="font-family:Arial">The Tower’s webpage on the Catholic University digital collections site celebrates two main strengths and lacks two main weaknesses in its design. One strength is the ability to search within a scanned issue of the newspaper, making finding specific topics in the multi-page issues much faster and not requiring the user to read the entire paper. Since there are issues of The Tower for every month of the year dating back to 1922, the search function is critical to quickly sorting through the scanned papers to find important and applicable information. Without the search function students and professors would need to talk to a librarian who was already familiar with the contents of each issue of The Tower.</p>

</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial">Another strength is the “sort” function that allows a user to see the issues by year and month, making browsing interesting and easy if the user is looking for commentary on points in history that are famous or of personal interest. A large part of archiving and libraries is to share information widely and at a university the goal is to reach both students and professors, not only to provide accessible research for classwork but also to educate on the university’s history in an enjoyable way. The “sort” function enables this by making browsing effective and fun as a user can pick only dates that capture their attention without needing to scroll through large amounts of data.</p>

</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial">One of the webpage’s weaknesses is that metadata is unreachable in the current layout as the “Info” page is cut off and other listed data returns illegible information, such as “, ()” for the input “contributor”. Metadata is vital to libraries and archives for both the administrators and users, so the lack of this data for The Tower presents an integral problem for those accessing issues of the newspaper who need more information than what is exactly contained inside the text of the paper. Without accurate metadata The Tower’s site is incomplete as an educational resource.</p>

</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial">Another weakness of the site is that although the site sometimes features breadcrumbs, oftentimes the user will navigate to a new page and the breadcrumbs will disappear making it difficult to return to a search or the main homepage. The website also lacks pull-down menus and page titles so without breadcrumbs a user can certainly become lost and may have to return to the original homepage in order to reorient themselves. This wastes a user’s time and makes it hard to track and return to pages a browser wants to use and save, defeating the point of providing The Tower for education for both classes and personal use.</p>

<h3 style="font-family:Calibri">Heuristic Analysis versus Mini-Usability Test</h3>
<ul style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;text-align right;font-family:Calibri">
    <li>After comparing the heuristic analysis with the mini-usability test there are clear similarities and differences between an MLIS student user and a novice user. One similarity is the agreement that the search function within the scans of The Tower issues is effective to use and returns relevant results. Since this feature is common on other websites it is to be expected that any user who regularly browses websites and PDFs will know how to use the function without explanation making it a positive and helpful tool on the website. /li>
    <li>Another similarity is the difficulty navigating between The Tower’s different web pages within the university library website due to the lack of breadcrumbs and the lack of general menu options on the page. The tester often had to return to the original homepage to restart a search which aligned with the heuristic analysis.</li>
    <li>Two differences are the knowledge of the search function for the entire website and speed of finding relevant information, both of which are related. The tester treated the website’s search function as they would Google, by inputting a long question or a string of words for the search term. This returned no results or took the tester to the library’s main site, as opposed to specifically The Tower’s site, and caused frustration for the tester and made their search for a topic extremely slow and in 20 minutes they were unable to locate wanted information. An MLIS student with knowledge of different types of search engines knew that a simple search term was needed as the site’s search engine was far more limited than Google and this knowledge resulted in faster finding of information.</li>
    <li>Suggested improvements for The Tower’s website include providing a guide for searching for topics and adding more intuitive navigation tools. By including a usage guide next to the search box, a user can alter their search terms to align with the capabilities of the site’s search engine and the guide can educate a user on the most effective way to locate relevant topics within the limitations of the site. </li>
    <li>More navigation tools (like breadcrumbs and pull-down menus) will improve a user’s experience in returning to previous pages and understanding where they are within the site, leading to less frustration and lost information.</li>
