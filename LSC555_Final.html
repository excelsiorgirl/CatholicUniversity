<h2 style="font-family:Arial;"><u>Description of the Organization and Information System</u></h2>
<h3 style="font-family:Arial;">Introduction to National Library of Medicine and its Databases</h3>
<p style="font-family:Arial">The National Library of Medicine (NLM) was founded in 1836 and organized under the U.S. Army until it was made part of the National Institutes of Health in 1956. The NLM is tasked with serving a diverse audience — researchers, librarians, health practitioners, and the public, all of whom have widely different needs and expectations for their search information. This discussion will assess the content quality and ease of operation for users of NLM’s information system and a proposed solution to improve the information system to better serve NLM’s mission.</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial">The library’s mandate is multi-faceted; its listed duties in the Functional Statement include assisting the advancement of health sciences through the collection and promotion of information resources for federal agencies, private institutions, and the public. Other duties listed are the support of developing biomedical libraries and other health information repositories, as well as the research and development of practices for recording, storing, accessing, and communicating health information.</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial">The NLM’s mandate is multi-faceted. Among the duties listed in its Functional Statement are assisting the advancement of medical and related sciences through the collection and serving as a national information resource for federal and private organizations and the public. It is also tasked with supporting the development of biomedical libraries and other health information repositories, as well as the research and development of practices for recording, storing, accessing, and communicating health information.</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial">This project’s assessment will focus on the online information system of the NLM that is publicly accessible. The library also maintains a physical collection in Bethesda, MD in addition to their robust online collection and several search portals serving a variety of purposes and audiences. The National Library of Medicine’s homepage, which is housed under the National Institutes of Health (NIH) website, has a search box front and center that can search all six of the NLM’s databases at once. The user can also choose to search a single database from the NLM homepage by choosing from buttons linking to each database located below the main search box.</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial">The NLM information system also shares news and events in the world of health information, highlights research in progress at NLM, promotes historical exhibits at the library, and has a section about their work on biomedical and clinical informatics. There are also links at the bottom of the homepage that explain the NLM’s background and mission. These sections are below the search function on the homepage, evidently not the top priority of the system, but an important part of the library’s work supporting and promoting research on organizing and making accessible health data and information.</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial">PubMed is an online medical database that includes more than 37 million citations for biomedical literature from MEDLINE, life science journals, and online books. It advertises trending articles and some of the latest articles from highly accessed journals but has no other browse functionality. PubMed is a fully functioning webpage in itself, including a user guide and FAQs page, a separate search function and citation matcher, and its own account and profile settings.</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial">Medline Plus is an online health information resource for patients, their families, and friends. Its link to NLM is that it provides information and links about health topics like medical tests, genetics, drugs, recipes, and more. Many health organizations use Medline Plus Connect to link patient portals and health records systems to this database. There is no advertising on this website, and many resources are available in both English and Spanish.</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial">Open-i is an experimental, open-access search engine for biomedical images. This NLM service enables the search and retrieval of abstracts and images (including charts, graphs, clinical images, etc.) from the open-source literature and biomedical image collections. Users are able to search with either text or reverse-image searching. Each picture comes with a title, author credits, an affiliation, and a “Bottom Line” section that summarizes the entire study the images came from. Unlike most other pages linked on NLM, this page's results link to resources on Medline Plus and MeSH. </p>

<p style="font-family:Arial">MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) is a sub-section of the NLM website that provides a search function of the PubMed database as the main feature. It is not federated but a fielded search and includes features such as autocomplete, relevance-ranked order, and an advanced search option that uses Boolean logic. There are tutorials linked on the page letting users know to input single search terms and short strings as a full sentence returns with no results.</p>


<p style="font-family:Arial">The ClinicalTrails.gov sub-section of the NLM website provides users with a search function that pulls from an undisclosed database and returns results of relevant clinical trials from U.S. federal agencies and other industry players. The function uses an advanced search with tips on how to fill out each field, an auto-population feature, and a way to save previous searches. The web page includes six drop-down menus at the top of the page that navigate to a variety of resources for users who need more data..</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial">The BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) web page functions offers users a single search bar with limited inputs (genomic strings for organisms.) There are also a variety of similar search functions that have a narrower field as there is no advanced search or filtering option. The web page also features a short explanation as to how the BLAST program works, search history and help buttons, and a blurb of the latest news article from the program.  </p>

<h2 style="font-family:Arial;"><u>Evaluation of existing information system</u></h2>
<h3 style="font-family:Arial;">Heuristic Analysis</h3>
<h4 style="font-family:Arial;"><i>Consistency and Standards</i></h4>
<p style="font-family:Arial">The National Library of Medicine’s system is in some aspects organized in a predictable and familiar way, but could make some improvements to be more consistent and in line with industry standards.  The centrality of the search box and its functionality to search the entire NLM system is helpful, and consistent with how users familiar with Google are accustomed to a search engine functioning. The navigation links above the search bar are also helpful because they follow conventions of directing users based on their identity and the task they are trying to complete.</p>

The centrality of the search box and its functionality to search the entire NLM system is helpful, and consistent with how users familiar with Google are accustomed to a search engine functioning. The navigation links above the search bar are also helpful because they follow conventions of directing users based on their identity and the task they are trying to complete.</p>

<h4 style="font-family:Arial;"><i>Error Prevention</i></h4>
<p style="font-family:Arial">The NLM information system attempts to prevent errors by offering multiple ways for users to funnel themselves into different areas of the system based on their profile and goals, but these efforts are not always successful. For example, the different options for filtering search results described above are in theory helpful for directing a patient to information intended for a layperson and a scientist to information appropriate to them, but it is not totally clear what each category is. For example, what are “Exhibits and Collections” and who are they for?</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial">Another problem is that there is not an obvious way for the user to signal who they are and what their goal is before entering a search term. The NLM attempts to help users do this by including direct links to different databases underneath the universal search bar with brief explanations of what each does. This might help direct some users to the right place, but not all. The NLM struggles with sorting their users into the right place to find the information they need.</p>

<h4 style="font-family:Arial;"><i>Recognition Rather than Recall</i></h4>
<p style="font-family:Arial">The NLM information system does not succeed in facilitating recognition rather than recall. The main reason for this is that the interface changes dramatically between different databases. Because the navigation is not consistent between different parts of the system, the user has to remember how to navigate based on where they are, or learn or relearn how to navigate a particular area of the system. Some of the individual databases themselves do better jobs than others at not asking their users to remember how to navigate them, but the variance between parts of the system is jarring and unhelpful.</p>

<h4 style="font-family:Arial;"><i>Response Time</i></h4>
<p style="font-family:Arial">The website has limited features to provide users with information about loading wait times as there are no loading bars or percentage markers to inform them on how long the website needs to return the output that the user input. There is a loading icon with three oscillating dots that appears when waiting to navigate between web pages. In addition, the web pages on the site are text and photo heavy; many pages have three columns for text with multiple rows, each one paired with a photo. The large pages are not broken up and it takes long scrolls to reach the end of the page. However, the site loads extremely quickly with waiting times lasting under five seconds and the loading icon often is not needed. Although the speed is satisfactory despite the large amount of data on the site pages, the minimal response time features mean that if the website ever crashes there will be no existing loading feature to fall back on and may invoke frustration for users.</p>


<h4 style="font-family:Arial;"><i>Interaction Efficiency</i></h4>
<p style="font-family:Arial">The website has very positive interaction efficiency. The main home page has buttons to navigate to the six main site features so users can immediately find what they are looking for without having to search or scroll. The main home page also features a search bar and drop-down menus on a menu bar at the top of the page to provide users with paths to information categories. To find a linked web page with specific information it generally takes four clicks or less. One weakness is the number of buttons and menus and the amount of options each one contains. There is an aspect of information overload and the user must read through the many options before seeing the one they need. There seem to be endless hyperlinked options to sort through if the user is inclined.</p>


<h4 style="font-family:Arial;"><i>Colors</i></h4>
<p style="font-family:Arial">The website is entirely colored in shades of blues and grays which aligns with the NIH and NLM logos but leave much to be desired regarding readability and accessibility, as well as making the website features hard to stand out. Every menu, button, clickable input, and background is either a blue or a gray color making the options blend into each other with important functions disappearing into the web pages. The similarity of colors also creates eye strain for the reader as much of the text is light gray on dark gray or light blue on dark blue. The site is not accessible for those with low vision as the colors are low saturated. However, the use of blue benefits the site since the shade of blue is the exact same shade found on the agency logo which creates a recognizable brand and provides consistency.</p>


<h4 style="font-family:Arial;"><i>Flexibility and Efficiency of Use</i></h4>
<p style="font-family:Arial">The NLM Information System does not prioritize flexibility or efficiency of use for its users. The website does not guide users, make search results easy to filter, or provide shortcuts or customizations. These oversights increase the amount of time users need to spend acclimating to the website before they can even start searching for what they need. There is no way to sign in on the main page, so you cannot personalize your experience or save specific pages or articles. </p>


<h4 style="font-family:Arial;"><i>Aesthetic and Minimal Design</i></h4>
<p style="font-family:Arial">The aesthetic is discussed above in terms of color and design choices. However, nothing about the NLM Information Center is minimal in terms of content or information. They have a major issue with information overload. This principle states that there is no need for irrelevant information and that it is important to minimize units of information. NLM has not addressed these suggestions. While their large amounts of information are separated into different pages and linked platforms, it does not decrease the amount of unnecessary resources present. </p>


<h4 style="font-family:Arial;"><i>Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors</i></h4>
<p style="font-family:Arial">NLM does not make it easy for users to recognize, diagnose, or recover from errors. One major issue involves the abundance of medical articles and journals the platform directs you to. While it displays thousands of search results for most terms, many medical articles require paid database access to read. The system does not anticipate this as an error, so it does not indicate access problems from its search results. There is currently no way to overcome this issue.</p>

<h4 style="font-family:Arial;"><i>Help and Documentation</i></h4>
<p style="font-family:Arial">While this system offers very little self-help training for users, it tries to anticipate every question users might ask. The Help section is different on each sub-platform. On the main website, you can find the NLM Support Center with dozens of frequently asked questions at the bottom of the Home Page. Separated into categories, it would be easy to find the answer if you know how NLM might designate your question. If you can’t find your answer there, you can contact their “help desk.” This link lets you submit a request form with a question that will, presumably, be answered by a real person. This is a less efficient option. </p>


<h2 style="font-family:Arial;"><u>Prototype Proposed Improvement to System</u></h2>
<h3 style="font-family:Arial;">Identified Issue</h3>
<p style="font-family:Arial">The primary issue with the National Library of Medicine’s (NLM) information system is its lack of focus. As noted above, the NLM is tasked with serving a diverse audience that has a wide range of goals in visiting the website and vastly different levels of scientific expertise. The NLM also highlights historical archives, research, resources for health information practitioners, news, and more on their homepage. As a result, the homepage is cluttered, the search function is confusing, and the search results are overwhelming.</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial">The biggest pain point is the federated search function on the homepage. The NLM has a single search box that pulls from six databases, despite their wildly different purposes, rules for access, and intended audiences. For instance, a single search could pull results from PubMed, which is intended for patients and their families, and BLAST, a tool that searches biological sequences, and is intended for researchers. As noted above, the search results page serves a muddled list of results - some are intended for those with a lot of scientific expertise and some for lay people.  The effect on the end user is a mishmash of results that is overwhelming and difficult to navigate. Instead of sorting users by task and identity before they enter a search term, the NLM returns all possible results and asks users to sort themselves once the search results are returned. This requires far too much knowledge of the system and the range of resources it offers. Researchers or practitioners who use the site regularly might be able to do this, but it’s not a reasonable expectation for patients and their families. </p>

<p style="font-family:Arial">Another major problem with the NLM system is that the breadcrumbs and navigation are not consistent, and the website sends its users to different web environments without explaining where they are going or how to get back. For example, if from the home page you choose to explore the “MeSH” database, there is no navigation to return you to the homepage from the main “MeSH” interface. Instead, if you click on the logo at the top of the page, which on most websites returns you to the home page, you are taken to “The National Center for Biotechnology Information” database. Upon closer inspection, that logo, which is visually identical to the NLM logo, is actually for the National Center for Biotechnology Information. The user has been taken to a totally new database with no means of returning to where they started. In addition to better filtering users before they put in search terms, the navigation and breadcrumbs in the information system need to be made clearer and appear on every page.</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial">We will focus on offering solutions to three main problems on the National Library of Medicine website:  making the search function easier to navigate for all users, improving breadcrumb navigation by making it clear, consistent, and present on every page, and decluttering the home page so it is easier to navigate. </p>

<h3 style="font-family:Arial;">Methodology</h3>
<p style="font-family:Arial">Our proposed methodology to finding a solution to the above three issues are focus groups and useability tests with eye tracking devices with the intent to discover what kinds of users are accessing the NLM databases, what their individual goals are, and how they navigate the existing website. The first method of focus groups will show user experience researchers the NLM websites various patrons and their needs. Our study will involve two focus groups, one consisting of ten participants from academia who are currently employed by the NIH and one group of ten participants who are current patients in NIH clinical studies. We selected these demographics based on their medical literacy statuses, their involvement with the NLM’s parent organization the NIH, and their proximity to the NLM mission goal that “promotes and provides access to health information in communities across the United States.”</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial">Each focus group will follow a guided discussion format where the ten participants will be shown the NLM website and asked questions centered around how the website may assist in their professional development or understanding of their health situation, respectively. Guided questions will include the following:</p>

<ul style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;text-align right;font-family:Calibri">
    <li>What is your first impression after seeing the website?</li>
    <li>What do you like or dislike about the website?</li>
    <li>Do you feel that there are challenges for you to use the website?</li>
    <li>Are any parts of the website easier to understand than others?</li>
    <li>If you could change something about the website, what would it be?</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-family:Arial">The focus group participants will be free to discuss and talk to each other as they respond to the guided questions and the researcher who facilitates the discussion will be accompanied by another researcher who will record notes on participants comments and body language. The groups’ discussions will be recorded, with consent, and reviewed afterwards.</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial">In addition to the focus group discussions, the participants will each take part in a useability test on a computer with an eye tracking device. The user will be asked to find the answer to the question “Find three scholarly articles about antibiotic treatment for pneumonia.” The user will be given 20 minutes to navigate the website with the goal of answering the question while a researcher observes their actions and attitude. The observation notes and the eye tracking data will then be evaluated side-by-side the focus group results to provide recommendations for reducing the clutter on the website’s homepage, improving the search function, and providing navigation tools and markers. </p>

<h3 style=";font-family:Arial;">Possible Solutions</h3>
<p style="font-family:Arial">While many of the proposed solutions depend on the results of the focus groups and usability tests with an eye-tracking device, these are some foundational recommendations. The majority of the current issues with the National Library of Medicine’s website are an overload of information without appropriate ways to filter or tailor it for individual users. Along that vein, our proposed solutions have to do with two critical issues: repetitiveness in search functionality and personalizing the entire website experience based on your intended use. </p>
<p style="font-family:Arial">First, to address navigation issues and patrons being overwhelmed by the Homepage, we recommend immediately asking users to indicate their intentions to visit the website. A pop-up asking whether a user is accessing the website as a patient/carer or health provider/researcher can introduce this. While user navigation issues and confusion can be more specifically addressed after conducting both the focus groups and usability testing, providing the opportunity for users to filter their content preferences immediately will eliminate a lot of confusion. At a minimum, the home page can be segmented to highlight the resources most likely needed by patients and carers or by health providers and researchers. </p>
<p style="font-family:Arial">It will not eliminate access to any of the linked databases, but it can narrow both the number of links accessible from the homepage and automatically filter out search results from incompatible databases. To save this preference, the website can recommend that users who intend to revisit this website save their navigation choices and search history as part of creating an account. Some individual databases offer login options, but the databases do not speak to each other. This further impedes accessibility and contributes to repetition issues. By combining the account functionality of all the databases and tying it to the homepage, users should be able to navigate all the information better. It will also allow them to bookmark their resources and frequently used pages for future reference– a support system for providing better navigation tools and markers. </p>
<p style="font-family:Arial">In addition to segmenting users based on their identity and preferences, we also suggest adding breadcrumb navigation to the top of every page, so that users can always navigate back to where they started.</p>
<p style="font-family:Arial">Finally, while the NLH website has an FAQ page and a way for users to submit help requests, we recommend the introduction of an AI Chatbot. Many websites nowadays use this technology to help direct users if they are confused. Even by incorporating all of the proposed changes, users may still need help or be overwhelmed by an entirely new operating system. By having a chat popup appear at the bottom right corner of the NLH Homepage, users will always be able to find help when they need it. They don’t need to go searching for the FAQ page for their designated database or rely on a submission form that can take multiple business days to yield results. While the AI will not replace human intervention entirely, it can be trained in NLH’s key problem areas. </p>
<p style="font-family:Arial">By starting to implement these changes to the National Library of Medicine’s interface and relying on studies and focus groups to further clarify user needs, the resources can start serving their intended purpose with their intended audiences. </p>

<h2 style="font-family:Arial;"><u>Conclusion</u></h2>
<p style="font-family:Arial">The National Library of Medicine has a multi-faceted mandate - it is tasked with advancing health sciences, providing information to researchers, librarians, health practitioners, and the public, and supporting other health information repositories, among other goals. It is a difficult mission to achieve, and the problems we found in its information system reflect that. </p>
<p style="font-family:Arial">We evaluated the system using the Nielsen heuristic usability evaluation method, and found three main issues that we proposed solutions for. They are a search function and search results  that are difficult to navigate, missing or underdeveloped breadcrumb navigation, and a cluttered home page. </p>
<p style="font-family:Arial">To address these problems we plan to conduct both focus groups and useability tests with users of different roles and scientific backgrounds - one group will be composed of NIH employees, and another of patients enrolled in clinical trials. All participants will be part of focus groups and usability tests using eye-tracking technology. Our goal with these tests is to determine why people are coming to the NLM website, how they are using it, and what challenges they face then they attempt to navigate it. </p>
<p style="font-family:Arial">While our final recommendations for solutions will be guided by what we find in our usability and focus groups, we suggest implementing a few changes up front to help make the website easier to navigate for all users. First, we suggest adding a pop-up to the home page when a user visits that allows them to say whether they are a patient or researcher. The system will use that information to tailor what they see on the home page and which databases are highlighted and given precedence in search. By prioritizing the content the user sees, the experience of navigating the website and using the search function will be less overwhelming. We also suggest adding breadcrumb navigation to every page so the user can navigate back to where they started.</p>
<p style="font-family:Arial">Next, we recommend giving the user the option of creating an account. For frequent visitors this will be a useful tool that will allow them to save their preferences, identity, and searches so they don’t have to re-identify themselves each time they visit. Since the NLM website serves users who are likely to use the same resources multiple times, this option is well-suited to its audience.</p>
<p style="font-family:Arial">Finally, to address the breadth of the offerings on the NLM website that might still cause some confusion despite the other solutions we propose, we recommend instituting an AI chatbot that can be accessed from any page on the website. This improves on the current FAQ page with the option to request help because it will be accessible when the user runs into a problem without requiring them to navigate away. </p>
<p style="font-family:Arial">We hope that these changes to the NLM website and search function will help it better fulfill its mission by making the website more focused on serving users and connecting them with the information they seek, rather than overwhelming them with the breadth of information that the National Library of Medicine holds. </p>
